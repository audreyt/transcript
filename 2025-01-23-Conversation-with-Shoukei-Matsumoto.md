# 2025-01-23 Conversation with Shoukei Matsumoto

### Audrey Tang:

(laughs) Yes, we have been a full hour.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

A full hour?

### Audrey Tang:

Yes.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Till you sleep.

### Audrey Tang:

Till I sleep.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

That’s right.

So, so the eight hours you said—are they consecutive?

### Audrey Tang:

If I can, but it doesn’t matter.

I can also do four and four.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Four and four?

### Audrey Tang:

Yeah, five and two and one.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

But in total, you keep eight hours.

### Audrey Tang:

Yeah, I don’t defer the debt. Interest rate too high.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

I see. So, yeah, thank you so much for accepting.

So my intention is, in the first place, just having a chat with you, but I really respect your policy to make whatever you say public.

### Audrey Tang:

Yeah, public domain.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Public domain.

So, okay, how can I use this precious conversation with you?

So then—oh, I have a podcast program in English.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes, you can edit however you want and use that for your podcast.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Thank you. And also, so you said you want to use this one, so…

### Audrey Tang:

You can do it for your podcast. I will just publish it as text.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Sure, sure. Yeah, textual transcript.

### Audrey Tang:

Yeah. The public domain doesn’t need to extend to your podcast. You can use whatever license.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Yeah. Okay.

So this podcast is around the question: How can we become good ancestors for the future generation?

So I will ask about your memory or relationship with ancestors, and from this question, go deeper—not only about your life story, but also your philosophy and vision for the future generation.

### Audrey Tang:

Okay.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Okay, thank you so much for joining this podcast program.

### Audrey Tang:

Yeah.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

So great to finally meet in person.

### Audrey Tang:

In high resolution.

We’re like pen pals.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Ah, yes. When I translated the book Good Ancestor from English to Japanese, just before publishing, I had a chance to meet you online, live. That was really a great opportunity to ask a question—particularly in that book, “How can we become good ancestors for the future generation?”

So, what you said really resonated with me, so I was happily surprised as a translator of the book.

You have a message around ancestors, right?

### Audrey Tang:

Yes, I want to be a good-enough ancestor.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Yes. So can we start by listening to your thoughts and ideas around this “good-enough ancestor”?

### Audrey Tang:

Sure.

When I first became Digital Minister in 2016, there had been no Digital Minister before in Taiwan. So the people in the Executive Yuan—our Cabinet—asked me to write my own job description. I wrote one when I was in Wellington, New Zealand. It’s very short. It goes like this:

	When we see the Internet of Things, let’s make it an Internet of Beings.
	When we see Virtual Reality, let’s make it a Shared Reality.
	When we see Machine Learning, let’s make it Collaborative Learning.
	When we see User Experience, let’s make it about Human Experience.
	And whenever we hear “the Singularity is near,” let us always remember: the Plurality is here.

So that’s my job description. The idea is not to solve everything for our next generation—to be a perfect ancestor. Because no matter what “perfect” or “optimal” means, if we just converge to a singularity, it takes possibilities away from future generations. We’d essentially be designing their lives for them.

But plurality means being humble—not destroying the canvas, but also not overcrowding it, leaving the future generation a wider canvas on which to paint, so that when we log off—or log out—of this world, we leave behind a bigger canvas than the one we logged into. That’s “good-enough ancestry”—not perfect, not bad, just good enough.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Wow. Such a beautiful job description, in the first place.

What you said resonates very strongly with the philosophy of Shinran in Japan. Shinran was the founder of Jōdo Shinshū, and he made a great effort to seek enlightenment on Mount Hiei, where many Buddhist students studied at that time—like a university for Buddhist priests. But after 20 years of practice, he found, “Oh, I can’t fully attain enlightenment because I can’t overcome my attachments and my ego.”

In regret, he left the mountain and went down to the city, where he met his teacher, Hōnen, who taught a different way of Buddhism—one open to anyone, not just monks but to all people. In this tradition, people accept the fact that they can’t fully become enlightened by themselves because of attachment and other human limitations, yet there’s still a way to become a Buddha.

So humility is central—like the philosophy of Socrates, knowing the limitation of our perceptions. In other words, the notion of a “perfect human” is an illusion and is very limiting. So, in that way, I found something very similar in your message and Shinran’s.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes. People know I sleep for eight hours a day; I have to do that. It’s my routine. But I don’t do it perfectly—eight hours consecutively. Sometimes I wake up in the middle; sometimes, because of jet lag, I do four hours and then four hours, or three hours and three hours and two hours—it doesn’t really matter.

So I think this is less about perfectionism. Seeing this shortcoming as an invitation, like Leonard Cohen wrote: “There’s a crack in everything; that’s how the light gets in.” That imperfection is an invitation for new ideas, innovation, and potential. If I simply followed the same perfect routine all the time, I wouldn’t have a chance to explore that flexibility.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Yes, totally agree.

I’d love to hear about your feelings and thoughts around your own ancestors. I’m not just talking about blood-related family ancestors but also teachers, friends who passed away, even historical figures…

### Audrey Tang:

…or Lucy.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Lucy, yes.

### Audrey Tang:

Well, my family name is Tang; my mother’s family name is Li. There’s a famous philosopher, Li Er—the person who allegedly wrote the Tao Te Ching, so the idea of Taoism started with that text. When I was a child, I had a heart condition that made it impossible for me to get too angry or too happy—if my heart rate rose above a certain point, I would faint and wake up in the ICU. That condition wasn’t cured until I finally had surgery at age twelve.

Because of that, I had to keep my emotions extremely stable. The Taoist practices—qigong, breathwork, meditation, visualization—were not just philosophy to me; they were survival skills. We don’t call it zazen, but it looks exactly the same, with Tai Chi, acupuncture, traditional medicine…all those Taoist traditions were part of my everyday practice. Even before reading the Tao Te Ching, I was living Li Er’s ideas.

My paternal grandparents were Catholics, so they had their tradition of prayer. My father eventually got into Tibetan Buddhism and many other schools of Buddhism. I’ve read many scriptures, but always as operation manuals—things to practice with my body, my life, rather than just to intellectually analyze. In that sense, I feel the ancestral practices come alive when I do them. It’s embodying the spirit of my ancestors.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

So you are a product of many different ancestral lineages.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes, definitely. Also, when I was four, the doctors told me and my parents there was only a 50% chance I’d survive until surgery. So every night when I went to sleep, I felt like I was flipping a coin. If I lost, I wouldn’t wake up.

That’s why even now I don’t say, “Oh, I’ll just sleep on the weekend.” Because for all I knew at four years old, there might be no weekend; maybe I won’t wake up tomorrow. So I learned to publish before I perish—I’d record on a tape recorder everything I learned that day, type it up, and publish it to the internet in the public domain. That way, even if I didn’t wake up, it wouldn’t matter. I could still be a “good-enough” ancestor for whoever came after. They wouldn’t have to wait 75 years for the copyright to expire.

So that idea of ancestry was also passed on to me, and I try to pass it on—hopefully in an even richer form—to future descendants.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Given that condition you had in your youth, you were always at risk of death. Could you elaborate on your notion of ego or self?

### Audrey Tang:

For me, the lifetime of the ego is one day. I only have continuity for one day.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

I see. So after eight hours of sleep, you get reborn, live one day, and die?

### Audrey Tang:

That’s right, yes—for eight hours I’m “dead,” and then I’m reborn. It’s like practicing dying every night for eight hours.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

That’s easy to say, but for most people, even if they understand it intellectually, they still feel, “I need more money, more property,” and all these things.

### Audrey Tang:

I don’t feel that way.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

You don’t?

### Audrey Tang:

I was just interviewed by a YouTuber from the channel White Crypto, and she was puzzled. I’ve had a Bitcoin wallet since around 2012 or 2013, and I used to consult for one Bitcoin per hour. But I never actually held any Bitcoin in the wallet for long. If a client paid me when Bitcoin was worth 100 or 200 US dollars, I would just spend it—maybe donate it, maybe buy a flight ticket to share some experience with friends. I never accumulated Bitcoin, so the wallet stayed empty.

That’s what happens when you have an ego that lasts only one day.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

It sounds like the mindset of people in Japan’s Edo period, when they’d earn money in the daytime and spend it that evening, living day by day. So from your perspective, how do you see this world that’s so focused on control, power, and ownership?

### Audrey Tang:

Well, on my keyboard, I see “Control,” “Command,” “Escape,” “Shift”…lots of different philosophies. But to me, the most important key is the biggest one: “Space.” It creates space for everyone, and it works with every other key.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

So the most important key is space—yes, in Japanese, 空 (ku) means emptiness or void, a central concept in Mahayana Buddhism.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes. When I filled out the HR form for my job description, in the Party Affiliation field I wrote 無 (void), and in the Gender field I also wrote 無 (void).

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

I’ve always had the sense that you’re like someone from the future. And here in person, I still feel you’re like a bodhisattva.

I once asked you online, “How can we become good ancestors?” and it was a privilege to hear your answer—“good-enough ancestors.” Do you remember how you responded?

### Audrey Tang:

No — that was a different lifetime.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Right, your previous lifetime.

But that ancestor of yours said, “Leave more options for future generations to choose.”

### Audrey Tang:

Yes! And today I said, “Leave a wider canvas.” Similar idea, different vocabulary.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

I see. Could you elaborate on the “wider canvas”?

### Audrey Tang:

Yes. Saying “leave more options” might sound like you’re giving future generations, say, five different choices, and they can only pick one. But “wider canvas” implies they can paint in multiple ways at once, combine different philosophies. There’s a sense of open space—空 (kong) in Mandarin, or the concept of 無 (wu)—which means anything can fill this canvas, interdependently.

It’s not that I give you five choices and if you pick one, the other four vanish. Rather, we empower our descendants to also become good-enough ancestors by leaving them an even bigger canvas. So a shared canvas is a better metaphor than discrete choices.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

That’s very inspiring. I often share your perspective with other leaders when I ask, “How can we become good ancestors?” Sometimes they say, “If we leave too many options or too wide a canvas, people get confused.” What do you think?

### Audrey Tang:

That’s why I prefer the canvas metaphor. If you just list a million options, it’s overwhelming. But with a canvas, you can start painting anywhere. It doesn’t matter. You don’t have to read through every possibility. A canvas is interdependent; you begin here, which touches other parts of the canvas. It’s all connected. That way, complexity isn’t paralyzing, because you can pick any simple corner and start from there.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

I see. From your philosophical perspective, we’ve focused on human choices, but how do you view animals, plants, and every other form of life and matter in the universe? Recently, thinkers in the Western world—like our mutual friend Glen Weyl—approached me about discussing AI and animism. I’m curious: how do you include non-human existences?

### Audrey Tang:

We’re already included. Some people exclude themselves from nature, but from a Taoist perspective, heaven, earth, animals, microbes, plants…they’re all our ancestors. Lucy may or may not have been a “modern human,” but she’s still our ancestor. It’s a matter of humility to admit this.

Some humans resisted the idea that Earth isn’t the center of the universe, or that we evolved from a primate ancestor; those transitions caused a lot of upheaval. And now, it’s hard for some people to realize that for any question with a clear right-or-wrong answer, machines can handle it better than humans. It all comes from excluding ourselves from the greater fabric—claiming superiority. If we see ourselves as part of the fabric, we just welcome new members, like AI. No problem.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

That aligns perfectly with my own thinking. We’re witnessing a shift in the meaning of “humanity,” especially in cultures heavily influenced by the Abrahamic religions, where humans are considered special, separate from other species—Neanderthals or Lucy are not “us.”

We used to think we were special because of our rationality and logos, which enabled science and civilization. But ironically, that same capacity produced AI, which now seems to dominate the logos realm—better programmers, etc. So we need a new foundation for uniqueness. Thinkers are rediscovering “We are animals,” with physical bodies, emotions, families, memories, mortality each night. That’s a key difference from AI.

Hence, the interest in animism, which recognizes spirit or presence in everything—animals, plants, stones, rivers, thunder. We don’t need to position humans as superior. Some cultures might feel pain in giving up human supremacy, but hopefully it won’t be as tumultuous as past scientific and evolutionary transitions.

### Audrey Tang:

Exactly.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Let me shift the question slightly. When I ask, “How can we become good ancestors?” people often think, “What can I leave behind as a legacy for future generations?” But we might also need to consider what we should stop or put an end to—so we don’t leave certain burdens behind, whether that’s pollution or maybe even GDP growth fixation.

As a Japanese Buddhist who often leads funeral ceremonies, I wonder, what would you like to hold a funeral for?

### Audrey Tang:

That’s a great question. I think we can hold a funeral for “human superiority” or “human supremacy in all dimensions.” The sooner we can lay that to rest, the sooner we return—inevitably—to the fabric of nature. Why not do it now, rather than extend this belief?

Maybe we can provide hospice care for those who can’t let it go immediately—help them find something fun to do first! But we can hold smaller funerals, step by step. For example, we once thought humans were better than computers at playing Go; then AlphaGo arrived, so we held a funeral for that superiority. And for chess, Shogi, transcriptions, voice synthesis, translations—funerals for each piece of human superiority. We don’t need a big funeral all at once.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Yes, we need a funeral for human superiority among species, but it also resonates within humanity—many people feel they need to be superior to their fellow human beings, right?

### Audrey Tang:

It’s like playing tic-tac-toe at three years old. Being the “superior tic-tac-toe player” matters when you’re very small, but by the time you’re six, you’ve outgrown that. You wouldn’t brag, “I’m the best tic-tac-toe player in the world!”

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

(laughs) Exactly. Building on that, people often ask me about growth or having a purpose, a dream, or a goal. But for someone like you, who essentially lives only one day at a time—what does having a goal or a purpose mean?

### Audrey Tang:

My goal tonight is to sleep for eight hours. Otherwise, my “descendant” tomorrow will wake up confused and with a smaller emotional canvas. It’s my basic responsibility to have a well-rested sleep so that tomorrow’s version of me can function.

Also, if I learn something from you today and publish this transcript, my responsibility is to put it in the public domain so people don’t have to ask for permission later. They might make a report, a manga, a film—whatever. I might not be around to say “yes,” so permissionless innovation is part of my duty to future generations.

Whereas if people insist on intellectual property, they see future generations almost as competitors—“Wait until I’m done with this idea, then you can use it.” That’s fundamentally different.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Do you consider yourself a long-term thinker or a short-term thinker?

### Audrey Tang:

If I remove myself from tomorrow, then “tomorrow,” “next generation,” and “seventh generation” basically become the same. I’m free to treat short- and long-term as having equal value. But if someone expects to be around for the next quarter, that short term will overshadow seven generations down the line. For me, any time period longer than one day is effectively the same.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

That’s a really interesting view.

One more thing: about AI, especially large language models—personally, I feel my notion of literacy has changed significantly since I’ve been exposed to them. These models analyze text through vector spaces. I used to focus heavily on exact wording, but now, with every translation prompt I feed into a large language model, it comes back slightly differently each time, yet the meaning feels the same.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes, the vector is the same—just different expressions, or different “fingers” pointing to the same “moon.”

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Yes! It reminds me of the classic metaphor: the finger and the moon. The “finger” is language—could be the Bible, a sutra, the Tao Te Ching—but it’s never the moon itself. The moon is beyond language and rational description—truth or deeper values, for example. Religious people sometimes get stuck on the finger, declaring “This text is the only truth,” right? Large language models treat words in a fluid, vector-like way, illustrating that the specific text is less important than the vector of meaning.

So in that sense, we’re in the age of AI, but also in an age that calls for new literacy. What do you think about new literacy in this context?

### Audrey Tang:

If we fixate on a single form of expression, we try to keep the canvas the same size, angle, and color as when that text was originally written—even if that text was the best expression of some truth at the time. We’re treating that moment’s environment as the only environment.

But if we accept that the canvas is growing and fluid, we can reinterpret or re-express the text for a new environment. People who cling to the text as “perfect” often feel compelled to keep the world unchanged, so that text remains perfect. It’s a kind of “perfect ancestor” thinking.

But if the canvas keeps growing, each day or each time we meet a new person, we might need new fingers, new metaphors. Whether the world is expanding and fluid or must remain the same—that’s the difference in mindset.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

As an author of a book about cleaning as meditation, let me ask you about entropy. Historically, humanity has generated countless concepts without really “cleaning up,” so the logos world is quite messy. We have so many words and ideas that it’s overwhelming. In anticipating this new literacy era, do you think we need to “clean up” all the scattered concepts?

### Audrey Tang:

When you say “clean,” I hear “reduce.” But reduction is only one method. We can also “reuse” or “recycle.” “Recycle” means we treat old concepts not as final forms but as raw material. “Reuse” means taking a concept and applying it in a different context—like the word “finger” being repurposed for language or a large language model.

So if our personal aim is mental order, then reduce is best—throw things away. But if we want to help the older world communicate with the younger world, we can reuse as metaphor. If we want to create something entirely new, we can recycle, re-combining the old to form fresh ideas. Like turning spilled coffee into brown paint on a bigger canvas. Whether you work alone, as a bridge, or as a creator of new canvases, you might use different R-strategies.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

So we can reuse what looks like waste—how creative! Thank you.

All right, let’s stop here. Thank you so much for coming on this podcast. I really appreciate it.

### Audrey Tang:

It was a lot of fun. Thank you.

### Shoukei Matsumoto:

Thank you so much.

### Audrey Tang:

Thank you.
