# 2025-02-27 BW Column: Countering the AI bin Laden Threat

### Audrey Tang:

Two weeks ago, I attended the AI Action Summit in Paris, where open models like Mistral and uncensored inference models based on the R1 series (including subsequent iterations like Open R1 and R1 1776), dominated discussions. At the summit’s conclusion, sixty-one nations jointly signed a declaration committing to develop technology in an “open, inclusive, and ethical” manner. To the surprise of many, both the United Kingdom and the United States declined to endorse the pact.

Some misinterpreted this refusal as a willingness to prioritize technological progress over safety. In reality, the opposite is true.

The United Kingdom has long championed AI safety, notably as the host of the world’s inaugural AI Safety Summit. The British government argues that the Paris declaration falls short in addressing the risks of AI weaponization and lacks sufficient, substantive, and clear guidance. In essence, it does not adequately prioritize national security concerns.

In a telling move, the UK recently renamed its AI Safety Institute to the AI “Security” Institute. While both terms translate to “安全” in Mandarin, their implications diverge. The latter signals a sharpened focus on thwarting deliberate attacks, reflecting the principle that “cybersecurity is national security.”

During the Paris summit, U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance issued a grave warning about AI’s weaponization. He underscored how authoritarian regimes are exploiting AI to enhance military intelligence, intensify surveillance, and amplify propaganda efforts, posing a formidable threat to national security. Vance affirmed that the Trump administration will adopt a resolute stance to comprehensively curb such misuse of AI.

In a subsequent address at the Munich Security Conference, Vance turned to the issue of election interference. He cited Romania’s recent decision to nullify its presidential election results amid suspicions of Russian manipulation through information warfare. He posited that if democratic nations can be swayed by mere foreign digital propaganda, it lays bare the fragility of their democratic frameworks. Only through the unfettered expression of citizens’ voices, he argued, can democracy be reinforced.

Vance’s remarks come amid the rapid spread of AI models capable of empowering small actors to launch large-scale attacks at minimal cost—an asymmetric menace akin to an “AI bin Laden.” With AI’s proficiency in coding and crafting persuasive narratives surging beyond human levels, even small-scale adversaries could, with scant resources, orchestrate disruptions like the foreign interference Romania endured.

As the global community stands vigilant against AI-driven threats to democracy, I shared Taiwan’s extensive experience in countering hybrid threats at the Munich Security Conference. I outlined concrete strategies for establishing collaborative defense mechanisms with allies. As the world increasingly recognizes Taiwan as a vital partner in AI safety cooperation, this moment also offers a golden opportunity for our nation’s cybersecurity firms to build on the success of our semiconductor industry and play a pivotal role in the global AI surge.
