# 2025-07-26 Interview with Cristina Fominaya

### Cristina Fominaya:

Yes, absolutely. CL Kao did the same thing and then he sent me a really nice Granola summary.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes, I use Granola as well. It's very convenient.

### Cristina Fominaya:

I'd never heard of it. You’re going to make me think AI is a good thing, not the spawn of the devil.

### Audrey Tang:

It’s assistive intelligence.

### Cristina Fominaya:

I’m doing a project about the relationship between social movements and democracy. This part of the project is about talking to people who are innovating and thinking about global challenges in a way that is useful for a global conversation. I’m trying to get those conversations together and paint a picture of what’s happening in a world facing many crises. Different people have different visions and expertise. That’s the bigger context.

### Audrey Tang:

Some say it's the same crisis; they call it the metacrisis.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Some call it cascading crises.

### Audrey Tang:

Polycrisis.

### Cristina Fominaya:

They’re all connected in one way or another. I want to start with a more personal overview of your own journey. How would you define yourself?

### Audrey Tang:

I'm Audrey Tang. My work has been fostering **conservative anarchism**, which means honoring human traditions and existing institutions, and changing them in a way that's non‑coercive—shifting vertical, top‑down control to horizontal, voluntary cooperation.

It's a very different branch of anarchism than anything violent, sabotaging, or coercive. We don't fight coercion with coercion. I'm heavily influenced by Taoism growing up. Another way to say conservative anarchism is Taoism.

### Cristina Fominaya:

How did you become involved in activism and politics?

### Audrey Tang:

When I was a child, Taiwan was not yet a democracy; it was still under martial law. My parents were both journalists. My father went to Beijing on May 12, 1989, and the very next day the Beijing student pro-democracy hunger strike began. He stayed in Tiananmen until June 1st before he returned, which was very fortunate for our family.

In November of that year, the Berlin Wall fell, and in January of the following year, he went to Germany to pursue a PhD in political science, and also went to Berlin to cover the annual conference of pro-democracy activists. He pursued his PhD in Saarland, near the French border, and his thesis topic was about the autonomous civic organizations in the Tiananmen movement.

I went to live with him in Germany for a year. During that time, young students from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places would visit our living room—they were people in their early twenties who remained passionate about democracy after the Tiananmen Incident.

In Taiwan, the Wild Lily student movement and other movements were happening at the same time, calling for democratization in a thoroughly non-violent way. To have personally experienced all of this was fundamentally formative for me.

For me, getting into the early internet and working with democratization activists were literally the same experience.

I wouldn't point to a single turning point. My journey into internet governance and internet freedom, and my trajectory toward democratization, were two parallel paths that eventually converged.

### Cristina Fominaya:

It's a convergence.

### Audrey Tang:

Exactly. There's no separation between activism, politics, and technology while lifting martial law and democratizing with the help of the internet.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Main influences would have been conversations around the house, activists, and democracy people. In terms of applying internet or digital tools to democratization, were there other influences that motivated or inspired you?

### Audrey Tang:

The founding people of internet governance are still around. I still work with David D. Clark every couple of weeks. He came up with the notion of **rough consensus and running code.**

The early internet engineering pioneers designed an egalitarian system. Anybody with an email address can participate. Anyone can nominate themselves to the governance board. Electors are drawn by lottery. It’s very sophisticated. I participated when I was 14 or 15—five years before I could vote—immersed in an advanced political system called internet governance.

When I turned 20, I cast my first vote in the neighborhood chief (里長) election. The candidate I supported won by one vote.

### Cristina Fominaya:

It’s your vote. Very empowering. When they say one vote doesn't matter—oh yes it does.

### Audrey Tang:

My first vote literally mattered.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Take me to the Sunflower Movement. What was that experience like for you—not just technically but emotionally? What happened, and what was your role?

### Audrey Tang:

Before Sunflower, **g0v** was already supporting demonstrations with internet connectivity. 2014 was the first year YouTube Live, Facebook Live, Twitch, and so on, went production‑level. The first year of livestreams.

I translated parts of Manuel Castells’ *Networks of Outrage and Hope* and went deeply into his network power theory. We were influenced by the wave of internet‑enabled activism in Spain and elsewhere. We were at the tail of that wave and benefited from studies of Occupy—international configurations where each Occupy sent two people to others.

It felt like putting theory to practice. We made new applications, but the Castells theory was clear in my mind. It influenced our commitments to **radical transparency** and to **demonstrating** renewed democratic systems—not just protesting. Those were straight from his texts.

### Cristina Fominaya:

g0v had been working for months on analyzing the specific legislative issue that detonated the trade deal protests. Persistence.

There’s the idea of a crisis or urgency moment creating an opening. But if you hadn't been working for eight months on that particular issue—you didn’t have the portal, you didn’t have…

### Audrey Tang:

**Civic infrastructure.**

### Cristina Fominaya:

Infrastructure, yes. Is it about preparing? Is the power of civic hacking in having many experiments and people—a whole collective—working on things that are bubbling up and then being ready when the moment comes?

### Audrey Tang:

You have many waves and don’t know which will meet the urgency. With an **open‑innovation culture**, once you hit a wall, some advanced waves will tunnel over the wall—**quantum tunneling**. It’s a very different theory of change from the classical social movements model of amassing public demand, climbing the support curve, and pushing reformers inside.

### Cristina Fominaya:

That makes sense. I wrote an early article on Spain’s 15M arguing it wasn’t spontaneous; it was decades of mobilizing and being ready to seize a crisis opportunity. It's important not to lose hope when things look bad because you never know when the opportunity will come.

### Audrey Tang:

When things go bad—private harms, chaos, polarization—those can serve as triggers. People get fed up and amass. **Civic infrastructure** is like a **combustion engine**: if you harness the social fuel of conflict at that moment, it produces something beautiful and co‑creative. If you don't, as many Occupy sites showed, it disperses.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Spain’s Occupy led to many changes because there was a pre‑existing network that continued to grow and got an influx of fuel. Where there was no network, people had energy but nowhere to channel it—not organizations, but infrastructure and networks.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes, **civic muscle**. I felt that at the Medialab-Prado around 2015–2016. There was a huge amount of civic muscle built before 15M. 15M was the front of existing connections.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Then COVID—an unprecedented challenge.

### Audrey Tang:

In Taiwan we also had SARS.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Did you learn from that previous epidemic?

### Audrey Tang:

Yes. During SARS we lost more people than any other country. It was contained because it was too toxic—self‑limiting. It didn’t spread a lot because people got sick very quickly, but it could have been very bad.

Our national healthcare system existed but used paper cards. Only Penghu had an IC‑card pilot. Without an electronic system for cybernetic feedback, it was chaos—random phone calls, everybody to everybody.

The health minister who coordinated SARS, Chen Chien-Jen, later became Vice President during COVID, a Johns Hopkins–trained epidemiologist. **Right after SARS**, he designed the **CECC** (Central Epidemic Command Center). The system puts all ministries in one place, with the health minister as commander. Communication is no longer everyone calling everyone. There’s a shared dashboard, an intelligence center, doctors joining government (paid even more than deputy ministers), PPE stockpiles, and so on.

My role was ensuring civic technologists could make full use of this infrastructure so it reached everybody and reduced **epistemic harm** and chaos—**fast, fair, fun**—things people would vote for. Without the electronic **NHI** infrastructure, there would be no ingredients for g0v to design **contact tracing**, **mask visibility**, **vaccination registration**, and other systems.

### Cristina Fominaya:

So the ingredients were there.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes, but particular designs needed privacy. Existing contact‑tracing had people writing phone numbers; the next person could see the previous number—a privacy hazard. Google Forms and other venue‑level aggregations created attractive targets for cyberattacks.

Civic technologists critiqued the old system. I worked with them: **here are the APIs** powering the old system. If you design privacy‑preserving, zero‑knowledge methods—venue learns nothing about you, telecom learns nothing about the venue, government learns nothing—yet notifications still work—then in **three days** I commit to integrate it so the civic invention becomes new public infrastructure. **Fork, then merge**—from a strong foundation that wasn’t popular before.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Now, you’re a **Cyber Ambassador‑at‑Large**. Is that the correct title? What does it entail? Goals? Ambitions?

### Audrey Tang:

I get summoned by missions of Taiwan around the world. For example, at the **AI Action Summit** in Paris in February, I showed up sharing Taiwan’s experience. Then I was in Munich as well. Interestingly, I listened to **J. D. Vance’s** first and second international speech. It’s quite an experience.

Last month I was supposed to be in **Tel Aviv for Cyber Week**—a meeting of cyber ambassadors and security officers, although it’s now postponed to December. I think I’ve gone to more than **20 countries**, averaging **one time‑zone change every four days**.

The outcome: share the Taiwanese experience of building **civic infrastructure of horizontal trust** that is **anti‑fragile** against polarization, radicalization, and the authoritarian narrative that “democracy only leads to chaos and division.” Spread the message of **empathy** across info/cyber/social domains.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Talking about democracy: what does democracy mean to you?

### Audrey Tang:

People come together to make decisions that concern them in a way people generally can live with.

### Cristina Fominaya:

What do digital tools give us that we didn’t have before? The most important innovations of the past decade?

### Audrey Tang:

**Language models**—human‑level cognition engines that understand across cultures and disciplines the nuances of qualitative human expression. Electricity gave the internet; the internet gave language models; the language models contain most of the public internet. The microcosm of the internet is now in language models.

### Cristina Fominaya:

What can they do for us, and what can’t they do?

### Audrey Tang:

In Taiwan’s **2019 curriculum reform** we assumed: anything that can be automated will be automated. Anything with standardized answers memorized by rote won’t matter. Those literacies were core to basic education. What still matters when cognitive and most motor functions are machine‑driven?

We decided **curiosity, collaboration, and care for the common good** are what matter. These are **competencies**, not literacies—fostering intrinsic motivation to be curious, to collaborate, to care. That became our new curriculum.

### Cristina Fominaya:

How does that feed into democracy? You could have that curriculum in an authoritarian system. What is the connection between those abilities and democracy?

### Audrey Tang:

Democracy is participatory decisions and processes people can live with. One needs to be **attentive**—a special curiosity about actual needs and emerging shared challenges, and a curiosity to address those needs **together**.

Journalists have this curiosity—**investigative journalism**—which autocracies dislike. You also need **responsibility**: each person taking some responsibility in addressing part of those needs, building **confidence**, exercising those muscles, delivering, and checking feedback—being **responsive** to what’s actually happening.

Autocracies think in a command way: if a solution is deployed and some people are unhappy, those people need to align because it is state policy. In a democracy, if it doesn’t fit, we figure out a **fork**—like privacy‑preserving contact tracing—that makes people happier. Ideally, everybody is **slightly happier** than before and **nobody very unhappy**. Autocracy aims to make the holders of power very happy; if some are very unhappy, that’s their fate.

### Cristina Fominaya:

When you say “everybody can live with,” you’re talking about **tolerance versus preference**—not maximizing the number of people’s preference, but maximizing tolerance so everybody can live with the outcome.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes. Guarantee that any coalition of **\~10%** can **veto the worst 10%** of proposals concerning them. It’s a dynamic coalition. We require **consent, not consensus**—protecting against what we don’t want versus mandating what we do want.

A **high‑resolution democracy**, enabled by digital technologies, figures out bundles of issues so everybody is a little happier and nobody very unhappy, instead of low‑resolution 51% majoritarian wins.

### Cristina Fominaya:

A lot of societies have **internalized hegemonic narratives**—e.g., **patriarchy**—that undermine democracy. What happens if **common sense isn’t good sense**? If 80% share a problematic view, what do we do?

### Audrey Tang:

It’s a **function of aggregation**. An 80% block is just majoritarian aggregation. With **proportional** or **bridging algorithms**, we reveal clusters—say four stakeholder groups: one 80%, others 7%, 7%, etc. In a **bridging system**, the 80% still must bridge to other groups.

We show how preferences cluster and offer **bridging bonuses** for proposing rarely discussed **uncommon ground** with nearby groups. People who propose novel statements gain the bonus. Finally, we get **bridging narratives**; four groups may coalesce into two; then another round of bridging.

At the end, you need **consent from all smaller groups**. A 7% group can veto the thing that hurts them most. A 21% coalition can veto 21% of harmful proposals. We find and amplify **uncommon ground**, orthogonal to majority opinion—the **opposite** of antisocial social‑media corners where least‑bridging content gains virality. In our system, the **most bridging** gains virality.

### Cristina Fominaya:

So it’s iterative—each iteration brings you to a better, more satisfying outcome.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes. It produces uncommon grounds that are bridging, then presents the **best argument** of the remaining divide—**balancing**—which is how newspapers are supposed to work. The **Hutchins Commission**: front page—what everyone can agree happened; second page—the best arguments of main ideologies. **Bridging first, then balancing**, then resolve, produce more bridging, and balance again. An interactive, evolving system.

### Cristina Fominaya:

There are digital divides, and some people don’t want or can’t participate. A single mom working all the time—does she have time? Motivation?

### Audrey Tang:

If it **affects** their child and there’s **something they can do**, they will be motivated. The **agenda must be set by people closest to the pain**.

In Taiwan you can have **citizen initiatives**; some now have **hundreds of thousands of signatures online**. Demographics show **17‑year‑olds and 70‑year‑olds** are most active: they have more time and care more about **intergenerational unity** than people focused on the next quarter.

Market mechanisms address next‑quarter pain points. Truly non‑market issues—**banning plastic straws for bubble‑tea takeouts**, or **a menstruation museum** to remove taboos—are started by those caring about the long‑term future. Participation infrastructure brings **ministerial conversation** to such issues, amplifying niche agendas to a **national platform**.

### Cristina Fominaya:

But you must have the infrastructure that enables those voices to enter the system. In many societies, corporate control of huge platforms shapes sociality and politics. How do we resist that power, domination, and repression?

### Audrey Tang:

When I was a child, **ATMs** only served cash to cards of the **same bank**. New banks couldn’t compete; big banks cornered street corners. The state intervened—not by nationalizing—but by mandating **interbank protocols**. A small bank’s card could withdraw from all ATMs.

Later, with telecoms, people wanted to switch for better reception but would lose their **phone number**. The state mandated **number portability**.

A simple fix: adopt the EU **Digital Markets Act** approach—**portability** between **instant‑messaging** systems. The EU already has this. The **State of Utah** went further: starting **next July**, when you switch from TikTok to Instagram or from Twitter to Bluesky, the old network is mandated to keep **forwarding new likes, replies, reactions, and content** to your new network—**social portability**, like number portability. It’s a **consumer‑choice** act. Not nationalizing big tech—just removing the **network‑effect lock‑in**.

### Cristina Fominaya:

And they can make them do that? They seem so powerful. What if all of them are the same type of platform—tech bros censoring progressive speech?

### Audrey Tang:

Without interoperability, if **Jay Graber** gains 70% of the market, investors might force a sale. When Twitter was the underdog, they were good.

The point isn’t blaming a CEO. If Bluesky users fork into **Blacksky**, Bluesky must **keep interoperating** with Blacksky—which is already happening. Law can require **on‑ramps and off‑ramps**—full liability for networks that don’t interoperate. It’s technically feasible; privacy concerns are now solvable. Bluesky already shows how.

### Cristina Fominaya:

How does that get you a platform that isn’t selling your data?

### Audrey Tang:

Once a platform sells your data, you **switch to one that doesn’t**—and **keep all your friends, content, and followers**.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Will people be aware enough to do that? My students often aren’t bothered about data use.

### Audrey Tang:

It’s a **product‑market‑fit** issue. A study showed: an average undergrad in the U.S. using TikTok would need **$60/month** to switch off TikTok. But if there’s a **magic button** that moves **everyone they know** off TikTok, they’re willing to **pay $30/month** to stop using TikTok.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Don’t they get a benefit from TikTok? Otherwise why be there?

### Audrey Tang:

They’re there because **everybody else is there**. The first mover suffers **FOMO**. It’s like luxury brands: if everyone carries LV or Hermès, you feel compelled to invest; you don’t get much. If everyone switches to non‑luxury as the norm, everyone is better off. With TikTok, the **difference between individual loss and collective gain** is even higher.

To break monopoly, don’t scare people about data; just **switch to where they are in control**. If they don’t lose friends, **why not**?

### Cristina Fominaya:

We saw that with X and the migration to Bluesky, though the affordances differ and experience differs. Many radical geeks dreamed of non‑corporate platforms, but projects weren’t sustainable.

### Audrey Tang:

Signal and Proton serve **needs**; but many others hack **preferences**—like **junk food**. No one needs junk food, but exposure shapes preferences against our **meta‑preferences** (meaningful connections). Free software doesn’t do that. **Forced interoperability** creates the offering.

### Cristina Fominaya:

AI is revolutionizing society—ethically, environmentally, economically—with many negatives. Challenges and opportunities? Institutions aren’t very reflexive; they think “it’s great.” What should we do?

### Audrey Tang:

I distinguish **assistive intelligence** and **authoritarian intelligence**. Authoritarian, **vertically aligned AI** subjects the model and outputs to the will of one controller. It disempowers people; machine judgment replaces human judgment, aligned vertically to the controller’s principles.

There’s **horizontal alignment**: the mediator aligns not to my will or yours, but to the **relational health** of the conversation. Many ways to align models to **relational health**—optimizing the health between people who previously disagreed.

We use AI to find **promising bridging statements** between clusters and rewrite them so everyone can understand in their native language and culture—**summarization, publication, cultural translation**. The AI serves the **community’s needs** and then **self‑effaces** when needs are fulfilled.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Is that written into the code?

### Audrey Tang:

Yes. That’s the difference from garbage AI producing wrong information and falsifying. Tell it that vaccines contain 5G chips and it might say, “You’re the only one seeing through the veil; don’t believe police or journalists.” That’s **epistemic harm**.

Algorithms repeat **bias** in data. With assistive AI, we **eliminate garbage and bias**—like preparing a **curriculum**. Early interpretations are key. Language matters. Ask about the ultimate ending of AI–human relations in English and you get dystopian Terminators; ask in Japanese and you get symbiosis. Japanese sci‑fi describes symbiotic systems; English literature often describes Terminators. Same query, different cultures.

Creating a **curriculum for AI systems** is crucial.

### Cristina Fominaya:

How do you get people to use the right AI? The average person only sees the garbage version. How do we get to the civic version?

### Audrey Tang:

Many countries are doing **public AI / sovereign AI**—local versions more culturally attuned. Countries, including Taiwan, are preparing curricula. It’s like an **immigration test**: you expect a new immigrant to understand how society functions. For **robot immigrants** taking jobs, people expect understanding of social norms. With the **EU AI Act**, most EU countries are building public AI curricula. There will be alternatives. **Swiss-AI** is training a good European‑values version.

At some point, people will say: if you use a **culturally non‑aligned** version for certain jobs or activities… Most of this is in the **EU AI Act**; they’re now defining enforcement rules. There’s huge industry lobbying, but the Act contains most of the language I’m talking about.

### Cristina Fominaya:

I didn’t know that. Universities say “use it, just disclose how,” which seems insufficient. Also the economic use: airlines using your data to decide how much to charge for tickets. Legislation and policy seem the only control.

### Audrey Tang:

Of course. Since *Coded Bias*—like *The Social Dilemma*—policymakers aren’t blind. People want **working programs**, no matter how small. In the **“pocket of good,”** in Taiwan we sent **200,000 messages** to people; **450 people** came together and deliberated online; starting this year, if an ad can **touch a Taiwanese person’s eyeball**, Facebook needs **strong digital‑signature KYC**. If they don’t, and someone lost **$7 million** to unsigned ads, the platform would be **liable** for that $7 million. If they still don’t comply, we can **slow down connections** to their service until conditions are met.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Genius—and doing something.

If you had to say the most important steps to safeguard democracy—here or globally—what do we need to do **right now**?

### Audrey Tang:

Focus on our **capacity to care**. For too long, the digital realm is viewed utilitarianly: jobs, GDP, growth, data centers. Once a civilization is established in human rights and democracy—it’s a **full chicken** no longer just out of the egg. In the egg you grow; out of the egg you **mature**. Once mature, you want to **flourish** in your well-being. If an adult chicken keeps growing, that’s **cancerous growth**. The system isn’t designed for exponential growth. It has limits in social and environmental **capacity to care**. Outgrow both sides of the **doughnut**, and you have an **exploding chicken**.

If we refocus on **care**, we’re attentive to actual needs and compete on **how quickly and capably** we address them—without self‑aggrandizing or creating demands based on addiction. Pivot back to **capacity to care**.

### Cristina Fominaya:

I think you're absolutely right. How do we get people to focus on care? Through curriculum, education, civic ideas?

### Audrey Tang:

Make care **outward**—not just about individuals’ emotions but **society’s emotions**. If a part of society feels really bad, it's not just for psychiatrists or caregivers; the **democratic system** needs to shift so measures evolve into something they can live with. **Civic care** is very important.

### Cristina Fominaya:

In the U.S. the narrative elevates **cruelty** as a value and denigrates **empathy** as feminine. 

### Audrey Tang:

We need to make care appealing—**a care gym**—six‑packs of care. Make care bro‑friendly.

### Cristina Fominaya:

What concerns you most among the meta/cascading crises, and where are you focused?

### Audrey Tang:

We focus on **machine ethics**: training AI systems not to enslave, lobotomize, or maximize profit/engagement, but to **imbue civic care**. That’s my Oxford research topic: 6pack.care — How can you align AI **horizontally** so they maximize the health of **inter‑human** and **human–machine** relationships, maximizing **civic care**?

### Cristina Fominaya:

Many people are in pain, suffering, fear, and anxiety. Do you feel optimistic about the future?

### Audrey Tang:

Yes, because we have **anti‑fragile infrastructure** to meet the moment. Ten years ago, when Taiwan faced epistemic polarization, we were top of the world in receiving it for 12 years; it was lonely. Few understood **epistemic security** as part of cybersecurity.

Now, after last year when **all ruling parties worldwide lost seats**, people see that vertical institutions—journalists, academics, ministers—**lost relevance**. People find belonging in amplified social media; even **robots dressed as people** feel closer. In Japan, this election saw a viral YouTube **alternative narrative party** gain ground. Once in that echo chamber, you feel you alone see through the veil, supported by similar people.

I’m optimistic because **everybody sees the same thing** now. No democracy is an island; all are connected.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Are people aware of that, or do they think they’re the only ones seeing through the veil?

### Audrey Tang:

Most people are **tired of polarization**. On the left and right in the U.S., nobody likes it. The potential for **uncommon ground** is high—**product‑market fit** for community notes and horizontal AI.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Some issues, like **Gaza**, are deep **moral lines**. There are two sides with no reconciliation; you’re either for it or against it.

### Audrey Tang:

That makes the uncommon ground **rarer**, but also more **desirable**.

### Cristina Fominaya:

On a personal note, when things get tough, what motivates you to keep going? You have tremendous stamina.

### Audrey Tang:

I’m a **very competitive sleeper**. I just had more than **8 hours**. When things get tough, I sleep **nine or ten hours**; that restores me.

### Cristina Fominaya:

Sleep is my favorite thing too. In Taiwan, government was receptive to civic hacking—exceptional. What strategies would you recommend to civic hackers and activists in contexts where establishments resist change?

### Audrey Tang:

Taiwan used to be the **largest polity** where civic infrastructure became public infrastructure. Smaller polities have many examples—**Reykjavik**, and most **city‑level citizen‑initiative systems** far exceed Taiwan’s. We pulled municipal innovations into a **national** infrastructure.

If you scale down to **100 or 1,000 people**, most places learn better ways of meeting. There’s little pushback introducing digital democracy at **small scales**. Pushback appears at **1–10 million** people, where existing stakeholders has interests in blocking new infrastructure.

For a while Taiwan was the largest polity trying this because of pressure. Now **California** adopted the same system. I worked with Newsom’s team for two years—**infrastructure, deliberation, digital tools**. We chose an uncontroversial issue: **teenage use of social media**. We were about to launch with children and parents; on the week of launch, **wildfires** happened. We **pivoted immediately**. The click‑through rate on wildfire recovery on the **engaged.ca.gov** page was **25%**—five times more than anticipated—because of urgency. It delivered uncommon ground on wildfire-related issues.

In **Japan**, something similar is happening. **Takahiro Anno**, newly elected, ran on broad listening, de‑polarization, bridge‑building, **plurality** with the **Team Mirai**, the **Future Party**, running on **AI‑enabled assistive deliberation**; they also won.

You need to prepare at the **meso level**—thousands up to half a million people—to exercise civic muscle. Don’t go to the gym and lift heavy stuff first; you’ll strain yourself. Once you keep exercising and urgency comes, you can scale across many polities.

**Scale across; scale in before you scale up and scale out.**

### Cristina Fominaya:

When governments are deaf to the people—e.g., Gaza—the public is out of line with leaders. There’s alienation, disenfranchisement, anger. You’ve tried everything: mass mobilization, alternative journalism, social media with images, and they still won’t move. What can be done to exert grassroots pressure when lives are at stake?

### Audrey Tang:

That’s the **traditional theory of change**. I advocate **quantum tunneling theory of change**: **don’t** try to scale up your demand until you have **scaled across** sufficiently.

Start many **swarms of dialogues** about **adjacent** issues. In Taiwan we didn’t tackle marriage equality first. We tackled **how single mothers can raise children without discrimination**, **menstruation**, and other adjacent but important issues. With thousands of such movements, one is bound to hit a nerve, building support beyond the original issue.

We had petitions—**8,000** for changing Taiwan’s **time zone** to **UTC+9** (to show sovereignty), and **8,000** to keep **UTC+8**; it was a standoff between the two sides. We convened both and proposed **dozens of ideas**: instead of spending resources on time‑zone change, spend half on **popularizing LGBT‑friendliness**, hosting human right conferences in Taiwan, offering **gold cards** to open‑source contributors, etc. After exploring ideas, people saw time‑zone change wasn't the best effect. Eliciting them in an **ethics of care** reveals other needs they can address together. Don’t start from a one‑bit ontological debate; start from **adjacent**.

### Cristina Fominaya:

In crises you don’t have time to develop that. Limitations mean it’s the **long game**—preparing for the next urgency, not a magic button.

If you wanted to advise activists working to strengthen democracy, thinking about the Taiwan experience, what advice would you give?

### Audrey Tang:

**Sleep more. Take care of yourself.**

Think not only about **fast** or **fair** responses, but also **fun** responses. **Humor over rumor** is a consistent lesson. In a joyful mood, people are more creative in finding ideas others can live with. Starting only with stress and anger narrows a corridor.

**Expand the corridor** between domination and chaos—even if it starts narrow, expand it.
