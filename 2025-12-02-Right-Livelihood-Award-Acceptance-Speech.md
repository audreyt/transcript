# 2025-12-02 Right Livelihood Award Acceptance Speech

### Audrey Tang:

四百萬年以來，
在海陸板塊的碰撞中，
台灣一直就是：
不斷向上，仰望星空。

Four million years. Plate against plate.
Taiwan: forever rising, forever starward.

Freedom and democracy did not fall from the sky.
They were forged under intense pressure —
cultivated by the blood, sweat and tears of those who came before us.

Polarization has long been considered a fire to be extinguished.
But in Taiwan, we learned a new way.

We learned that as the youngest tectonic island in the world,
crashing plates
give rise to a majestic verdancy.

We built a geothermal democracy —
one that transforms the negative heat of disagreement
into positive energy for renewal.

This is the challenge for all democracies faced with backsliding:
not to silence
but to channel conflict.

AI must not divide us with outrage.
It must connect us through uncommon ground.

We the people are the superintelligence.

To be Taiwan’s first Right Livelihood Laureate
is not my honor alone — it is ours.

To everyone who etched their mark on digital freedom,
to everyone waging peace around the globe:
thank you.

婆娑之洋，美麗之島。
公民之國，萬華之中。

Swirling ocean. Beautiful islands.
A transcultural republic of citizens. 

Let’s free the future — together.
