# 2026-01-17 From Taiwan to Germany: How Radical Participation Leapfrogs Public Trust

### Steffi Czerny:

Friends, from Taiwan to Germany, how radical participation leapfrogs public trust. Public trust is fragile, and once it's gone, it's very hard to win it back. So the real question is not only how we communicate better; it's how we design systems where people actually feel heard, involved, and respected. Systems that can handle disagreement. As we heard many times in the last two days, disagreement is important. It's important for progress to scale participation without turning into chaos.

We are very happy, very happy to welcome Audrey Tang, Taiwan's pioneering first digital minister from 2016 to 2024 and now cyber ambassador. Audrey is a globally recognized civic tech leader and has positioned Taiwan at the forefront of internet freedom and digital democracy. TIME, the magazine TIME, named Audrey to its inaugural list of the 100 most influential people in AI 2023 for impact in using technology for public good. It's an honor to have you here.

Zarah Bruhn was the one who introduced us. Thank you for this. She leads SPRIND Society at the federal agency for disruptive innovation. Zarah is building the Digital Democracy Lab, a real-world space to rethink citizen participation in Germany. It's very important. It's very important here in Germany. She's also a founder and social entrepreneur known for founding SocialBee, helping place thousands of refugees with companies and for her work at the intersection of innovation, society, and policy. I'm honored that you both are here. Thank you for your time.

### Zarah Bruhn:

Wow, this is so exciting. Actually, I've been looking forward to this moment for exactly three years because I looked it up when I visited you in Taiwan. That was three years ago.

### Audrey Tang:

It's a diplomatic breakthrough.

### Zarah Bruhn:

Exactly. And now we finally have that big announcement that we're going to make at the end of this panel because we are creating things together now.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes, we're co-creating the presidential hackathon model here in Germany.

### Zarah Bruhn:

Exactly. And what that is, I had to learn when I first went to Taiwan. I was the commissioner for social innovation of the federal government of the last legislation. And I got that email, hey, do you want to travel to Taiwan? There's this digital minister and she is doing amazing stuff in the tech ecosystem and also social innovation ecosystem. You have to meet her.

Then I flew to Taiwan and I didn't know what to expect. And then I met Audrey, and after that, I wanted to move to Taiwan, learn from your models, become, you know, I was like so blown away. I even wrote a chapter about you in the book that we should bring our models to Germany, and finally we are doing that. So it's a pleasure that we're sitting here together.

### Audrey Tang:

Yes, and streamlining the bureaucracy was the original reason I was brought in in 2016 as Taiwan's first digital minister. And I'm very happy to learn that "make it simple" is now also make it to Germany: "Einfach machen."

### Zarah Bruhn:

And we learned from you that humor is very essential when trying to disrupt the state, right? So maybe you want to start a bit. How did you actually become the first minister for digitalization in Taiwan? That was a process in itself, a revolution.

### Audrey Tang:

Certainly. So in 2014, I kind of invited myself in with half a million people on the street in a demonstration called the Sunflower Movement. In March 2014, people really thought that the trade deal with Beijing — that was being fast-tracked through — really sucks. So we occupied the parliament peacefully for three weeks and basically not just to protest what sucks, but rather to demonstrate what works.

We used technologies to listen to the half million people on the street, and many more online, on what they really wanted for trade deals with Beijing. And so we converged every day. We showed what was agreed the previous day and what remained to be debated this day.

After three weeks, the Speaker of Parliament basically said, oh, the crowdsourced version is better than the MP's version, so why not just go with it? And so I was tapped to join the cabinet as a young reverse mentor to the cabinet minister in charge of participation.

After two years working on that, I was promoted as the national tech support, the first digital minister. I guess this was like the OG DOGE, the government efficiency position, but not with a chainsaw — with chain reaction. We asked people what sucks, and then made it work together.

### Zarah Bruhn:

I think your story is kind of a miracle, right? The Sunflower Movement occupying the parliament and then actually winning them over and becoming a minister because your work was so great and amazing.

Can you maybe walk us through how when you actually went into the parliament and then maybe later in the ministry, what did you actually change? What did you find there and what did you change?

### Audrey Tang:

One insight is that if you do make government more efficient, saving the tax filing time from three hours to three minutes, through the platforms where we crowdsource people's solution to simplify tax filing, you also save the bureaucrats three hours of time getting complaints.

It's a win-win situation. You do not actually expose them to more risk if they are also involved in the co-creation. So we made two platforms.

One is called the Join platform, where everybody can petition, and once it reaches 5,000 petitioners, it can force a ministerial conversation about whatever people care about. So, for example, people under 18, like the 17-year-old, are the most active segment. They petition to move a school hour one hour later because one more hour of sleep gets you a better grade than one more hour of study, and they got it from the education minister.

But the 17-year-olds partner with the 70-year-olds. That's the second most active segment on the Join platform because both have more time on their hands, of course. But also, the 70-year-olds know the wisdom of how to pass down their values to the next generations, values of sustainability, of how to make things simple.

This intergenerational unity promoted what's called the Presidential Hackathon, which is how the local people in one district, one municipality, if they already have something, a working prototype of solving the problems on the Join platform.

Every year, we give five teams a trophy, which is a projector. If you turn it on, it projects the president giving you the trophy. So it's very meta. And it describes the commitment that this local innovation will be made into national infrastructure in the next fiscal year. So that uplifts all the local innovations into national infrastructure. Join for what sucks, and Presidential Hackathon for what works. 

I have one question for you. When we met in Taipei, you were describing your role in the ministry to promote social innovation. But now you're on an agency that is about breakthrough innovations. And you kind of designed your own job description, just as I did in 2016. Can you talk a little bit about the transition from the ministerial position to a breakthrough innovation position?

### Zarah Bruhn:

Yes, I mean, the first step actually going into the ministry, I founded a social enterprise myself, basically integrating refugees, and I got a call from the ministry if I want to become the first commissioner on social innovation, which I found kind of breakthrough as well because I didn't have a political portfolio, neither did you actually, right, which is kind of already making some space for entrepreneurs, super hackers like you.

So I was basically nominated to be the first commissioner, but I found myself in a ministry, which is of course quite extremely bureaucratic, quite not the pace that I was used to. And we could change a lot. So we released a big strategy on social innovation, the first one, and social startups, where actually also forced all innovation programs to be open not just for tech innovation but also for societal innovation.

That's where I met the SPRIND, the agency for breakthrough innovation, actually they invest or we invest in deep tech in fusion energy in quantum computing in Alzheimer disease in a very disruptive way but not yet in social innovation.

I called the SPRIND and said, hey, why don't you actually do social innovation yet? And then Rafael, the boss of the Federal Agency for Breakthrough Innovation, said, hey, why don't you do it here? And basically during my time, the Agency for Breakthrough Innovation was also allowed then to open up for social innovation as well. That's why actually we can now build all these innovating the state and innovating society topics.

### Audrey Tang:

So not letting the natural science have all the fun. We can have quantum democracy in the social science as well.

### Zarah Bruhn:

Yeah, I learned today that digital democracy is already outdated. It's quantum democracy now. While we are actually still doing it, you know, elections written on paper, all the four years. How is that in Taiwan right now?

### Audrey Tang:

In Taiwan, what we learned is the traditional Newtonian things — about bumping one party into one another — is reaching its limits.

So in Taiwan, for example, a couple of years ago, we faced the deepfakes online, we saw a lot of scam ads two years ago. If I scroll on Facebook, for example, I always saw Jensen Huang, the Taiwanese NVIDIA CEO, looking at me promising new investment advice or cryptocurrency. And if I click on it, "Jensen" talks to me. It sounds just like him. But of course, it's not Jensen. It's a deepfake running on an NVIDIA GPU.

What I make of that is that people in Taiwan, because we're the most free in Asia when it comes to internet freedom, people don't want the government to do censorship. So what to do, right?

We sent, through the government number 111, an SMS text message to 200,000 random numbers around Taiwan asking, what do you think about fixing this deepfake problem together? People gave us their ideas. And then we invited thousands of them.

And we whittled down to 447 — a statistical microcosm of the Taiwanese population — in rooms of 10. And then they debated. The 45 rooms each come up with the idea that can convince the majority of people in that room.

So one room said, let's display all ads on social media as "probably scam" like a cigarette label. And if you have a digital signature, you can take it down. Very good idea.

Another room said, if somebody loses $7 million from an unsigned ad on Facebook, then Facebook should be jointly liable for that $7 million damage because they profit from the advertisement. Why not?

And another room said, TikTok at the time did not have a Taiwan office, so what to do if they ignore our liability? Well, let's slow down connection to their video, 1% for every day they ignore us, throttling.

None of this is about content. None of this is about censorship. But we had a vote at the end of the conversation because we used language model to synthesize those ideas in superposition, the entanglement of ideas together, and then we measured.

More than 85% of people in the mini-public agree with this measure, and the other 15% can live with it. So it became law in just three months. Throughout 2025 — for the entire year — we just don't have deepfake ads anymore in Taiwan, that problem is just conclusively solved.

So we show that we can quantum tunnel through the walls of disagreement and partisan fighting just by asking people: what to do together?

> (applause)

### Zarah Bruhn:

So the will of the people, actually listening to the will of the people, and the ideas of the people out there, rather than censoring. I think that's a radical idea, and I mean it's the principle of democracy, right, that you're reinventing.

So now, imagine all of you get an SMS or a signal or WhatsApp message, "Hey, what are you saying against these deepfakes, what should we do?" That maybe can happen in Germany soon too, if you maybe sign up for us later.

We're exploring a lot of your tools and trying to bring them to Germany, and that's super exciting.

### Audrey Tang:

Do you want to talk about [the website](https://deutschland-was-geht.org/)?

### Zarah Bruhn:

The website, yes. Actually, one point is at the SPRIND, I'm building the agency for societal breakthrough innovation. So we basically have 16 startup founders. They're all crazy people that are looking for disruptive ideas, tech ideas, satellites, space ideas, medicine and so on.

And I'm actually building the vertical of societal and state innovations, which is really new. It's not even half a year old. And we are actually scouting internationally what works best, and how can we copy that to Germany.

Of course, you were the very first on the list on what we need to build and do in Germany.

So what we at the SPRIND Society are doing, is how can we innovate education, actually disrupt education? How can we innovate the societal welfare state? In the education area, we are of course investing in EdTechs, but in disruptive ones that may be changing the system.

In the social welfare area, we're investing in a project, where you can fill in your application to receive social support within a few clicks, rather than having a thousand documents, which creates so much frustration and so much fear in society.

In Germany right now, less than 20% of people really trust and believe in the state and the state system. And that's what we have to radically change in the different verticals where you experience the state a lot.

Now, the big vertical is also the topic of bureaucracy. Because that's the topic where the people are interacting with the state all the time. You're taking the train and it's late. You are trying to get a new passport and you need to wait six months and it's a crazy process.

That's where so much frustration in the society develops, that it's actually a social innovation to radically tackle that. And that's actually why we're launching our first kind of presidential hackathon. It's called "Germany, What Sucks?"

### Audrey Tang:

And "What works?"

### Zarah Bruhn:

Exactly. Where everyone in Germany can hand in ideas how Germany can work better.

And of course, we are filtering them. And also on the other hand, you can vote on the best ideas. Which ones do you like most? Where do you agree? Where do you disagree? We can really see how polarized or non-polarized Germany is in the different topics, and what the government should tackle first.

So it's also you're making the priorities what we are tackling in the government, especially in the SPRIND. And we are basically launching a challenge where your best ideas are taken into action, where civic tech teams are going to work on these ideas and bringing them to life.

But we don't know which ideas yet. So actually that's why we need all of you, the people, to hand the ideas in to make this work and to innovate Germany again. And that's just one of a lot of new ministerial challenges that we are going to launch at the SPRIND.

### Audrey Tang:

Amazing, turning complaint into energy!

> (applause)

### Audrey Tang:

A new geothermal energy engine that turns the polarization, the fire, the heat, not like wildfire that burns down the trust, but rather to renew, like a campfire.

I think that's very important. In Taiwan, in 2014, as I was mentioning in the Sunflower Movement, the administration was enjoying an approval rating of trust of 9%. So in a country of 23 million people, anything the president says, 20 million people against him. And those 20 million people are themselves very fractured, fragmented.

Already, by 2020, after we run hundreds of Join platform initiatives and Presidential Hackathon ideas, the approval rating is back at more than 70%. So in the span of six years, a dramatic increase.

But now, you can leapfrog this. You don't need six years. Actually, you can do it in six months, maybe, to win back the trust. Because now we have language models. What used to be that we do need time to sense-make, to weave together those ideas, but as we have seen in the Taiwanese deepfake defense example, just with one afternoon, those facilitators, those civic AI systems can actually weave together the superposition of ideas instantly.

You don't need to wait for one month for the reply, but rather you can weave together the Overton window to accept its slate of ideas immediately, and that leads to a flywheel of more participation and more quick democracy that's fast, fair and fun.

> (applause)

### Zarah Bruhn:

Audrey invented her models. I think ten years ago, and they are exported now. I mean Estonia is doing it, the Baltic states, now even the US, and yeah, hopefully in Germany. We can basically build on all your experience. Let's see if we are leapfrogging you.

### Audrey Tang:

Of course you are.

Yes, we are like the Estonia for radical participation because, the institutions were built ten years ago. It works very well, like, good enough.

But here, you have a lot of complaints about bureaucracy as new fuel. And I think what we are seeing now, also in the U.S., is that people think they're very polarized. And that is actually a lot of energy that can be tapped into.

In the state of California, I've been working with Gavin Newsom and Jennifer, his first partner, to build Engaged California. And we literally use the wildfire prevention and wildfire mitigation as our pilot project. And so, people just cut through their partisan differences. They talk about how to bury utility lines, how to build better support, ideas around Los Angeles wildfires.

So, as soon as there is a real crisis in a society, everybody looks past the ideological differences, and just quantum tunnel through to build the consensus and the co-creation together.

### Zarah Bruhn:

You said two different things. You said the one thing, the US is much more polarized than Germany. And on the other hand, you said this morning, the US is not actually polarized, it's an illusion. Look here at the facts. And you showed me a lot of votes where actually super polarized people agreed on the same things. That was so impressive.

So what can we hope in Germany, based on what you see in international movements?

### Audrey Tang:

Yes. So people are polarized about ideologies, but what unites people is what sucks.

If people all understand what sucks, that can then tap the polarization energy into momentum, like a geothermal engine, because everybody here loves "zero waste" of time.

The "zero waste of time", I think, could be this rallying cry that rallies the people from different ideologies into, again, "einfach machen."

> (applause)

### Zarah Bruhn:

And that's why, of course, we named the challenge "Germany What Sucks", right? Because it's super welcome. We love people that tell us what sucks, right?

You tell us what sucks, that's amazing. You tell us what can be done better, that's amazing. You give us solutions, that's also great. So both are great. The ideas are great, but also what sucks is great. All that creates common energy.

And we can vote on what sucks most, and we have a list of what we can prioritize first, tackle first, and invent new ideas. And that's actually all of Audrey's model inspired us so much.

We at the SPRIND, we can only do radical ideas. If it's small, we can't do it, you know? So actually, we really had to come up with great radical societal ideas, and I'm so glad we met, because her ideas and how it changed Taiwan, how it changed the US, are so radical that there's really hope also for Germany, for German bureaucracy, to maybe be disrupted, and we can leapfrog on your ideas. So thank you very much for that.

### Audrey Tang:

And I'll be supporting you from, actually not that far, in Oxford, with Civic AI and the Ethics in AI Institute, so that we can all free the future together. Thank you.
